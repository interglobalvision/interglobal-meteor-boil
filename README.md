# DONT USE THIS. It's really out of date now. Meteor+React is the new way it seems...

# IGV Meteor Boil

Starting point for our Meteor projects. Comes with some useful boiler for roles, user views, basic collections, routing and probably more...

```
git clone git@github.com:interglobalvision/interglobalvision-meteor-boil.git new-project
cd new-project
rm -rf .git
git init
```

**IMPORTANT**

Edit `.gitignore` and ignore `/app/settings.json`
